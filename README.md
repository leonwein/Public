## Forecasting US Micro Business Density Using Machine Learning Methods

### Abstract
This project has been a two-part analysis using machine learning techniques to investigate the behaviors and driving features of microbusiness densities in the US on a county level. The project initially started as a Kaggle competition sponsored by the company GoDaddy which structured the competition as a forecasting problem with over 3000 teams competing. The training data provided [1] was on a monthly basis where many novel time series methods were used to reduce the error criteria SMAPE (symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error).


## Significance Testing on Deep Learning Models

### Abstract
We recreate the study of statistical significance testing within the context of neural networks. This research was produced by Dennis Ulmer, Christian Hardmeier, and Jes Frellsen with a paper titled “Deep Significance – Easy and Meaningful Statistical Significance Testing in the Age of Neural Networks” ICLR (2022). The authors comment on the lack of statistically rigorous testing within the rapidly expanding field of deep learning. To rectify this, they provide a Python package for implementing a novel and powerful significance test called Almost Stochastic Order (ASO). Here, we will revisit the ASO statistic and compare it to a variety of well-established significance tests across numerous scenarios to illustrate the usefulness of ASO and statistical testing in general under machine learning architectures including a simulation study using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).

## Life Expectancy Using Linear Techniques

### Abstract
This project aims to explore the factors that affect life expectancy using linear models. The study utilizes a real-world dataset to derive insights and conclusions based on the techniques learned in class. The analysis goes beyond interpreting coefficient results from a multilinear regression model and provides an in-depth study of the factors that impact life expectancy. We aim to determine not only the direction of influence the covariates have on life expectancy, but also their magnitude; this includes establishing robust confidence intervals for the estimated coefficients.

## Pair Trading

### Abstract
I track 2 highly correlated stocks primarily in the same industry to buy and sell based on the deviation that occurs under the assumption that their prices will converge back to one another in a short period of time. This project supports backtesting for any given time period to measure its performance against the S&P 500. 

## Quantified Hapiness

### Abstract

this analysis sets out to quantify, from an objective standpoint, what indicators can be used to approximate a country’s level of happiness and where it ranks relative to others.
