Machine Learning Analysis of Microbusiness Densities Across US Counties

# Abstract
This project has been a two-part analysis using machine learning techniques to investigate the behaviors and driving features of microbusiness densities in the US on a county level. The project initially started as a Kaggle competition sponsored by the company GoDaddy which structured the competition as a forecasting problem with over 3000 teams competing. The training data provided [1] was on a monthly basis where many novel time series methods were used to reduce the error criteria SMAPE (symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error).
